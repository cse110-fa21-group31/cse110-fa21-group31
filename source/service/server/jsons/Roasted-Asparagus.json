    "steps": [
        "Preheat oven to 425Â°F.",
        "Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.",
        "With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all.\",string.\", and if you eat asparagus you know what I mean by that).",
        "Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.",
        "Sprinkle with salt.",
        "With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.",
        "Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.",
        "They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.",
        "The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.",
        "They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal."

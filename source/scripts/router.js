/** Some hints for this router:
  *   - the functions being passed in should mostly be stored so that
  *     you can call them later when you want to navigate to a page
  *   - you should be pushing to history (only when the 'popstate' event
  *     hasn't fired) so that you can use forward / backward buttons
  *   - You should be using hashes to update the URL (e.g. 
  *     https://somewebsite.com#somePage) - the hash is the #somePage part.
  *     It's accessible via window.location.hash and using them lets you
  *     easily modify the URL without refreshing the page or anything

         * 
         *  1. First, check to see if the function exists, if it doesn't log an error

         *     check to see if it exists nearly the same way you assigned it

         *     string, if page is anything else set it to be the string '#' + page, e.g.
         *     '#ghostCookies'
         *  3. Next, if statePopped is false and window.location.hash does NOT match the
         *     hash that you just made, use history.pushState() to add the current state
         *     and URL + hash to history

Technical Story: We decided to add "comments" as our second feature besides CRUD by using "Disqus". since our target audience is students, and students love to comment on things. We want every user to have a chance to post their own experience on this recipe, so other users could see some feedback on the recipes they loved.

## Context and Problem Statement

What are some features we could implement that are related to our user persona?
What tools we can use to implement these features? and not hard to learn.

## Decision Drivers 

* Workload: we only have ~5 weeks to implement this feature. 
* We shouldn't spend a lot of time learning and pay for the tool.

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Add a "Planting Tree" challenge to encourage students to try at least one recipes per day which will add one tree to their garden.
* Option 2: Challenge students to cook different level recipes and gain some kind of prize or title in their profile.
* Option 3: Add a "comment" feature to encourage students to try out different recipes and share their cooking experience with this recipe.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Option 3", Because we found that "Disqus" is a free comment add-on tool that allows us to implement the "comment" feature.

### Positive Consequences 

* {It Will take less time to implement than other options
* It is most related to our user personas.

### Negative Consequences 

* Our back-end team has to spend some time learning it.

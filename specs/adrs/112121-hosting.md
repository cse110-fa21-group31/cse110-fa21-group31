* Status: accepted  
* Deciders: Caiwei Xiao, Eric Filishtiner, Xin Sheng, Kian Ezaz  
* Date: 2021-11-21


## Context and Problem Statement

What technology can we use to host our app?
What hosting tech supports neDB, google login API, and Disqus?

## Decision Drivers 

* Time constaint: we only had ~2 weeks left for code
* Scope: we won't have a large amount of data
* 3rd Party API: the hosting tech must support the 3rd party apis we use

## Considered Options

* Heroku
* Glitch
* Github Pages

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Glitch. It has a persistent file system that supports neDB. And it's compatible with other API too. We're tested success with glitch.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We can save private data as well as hosting our website.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We need to check how to sync our progress on github to Glitch.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Heroku

* Good, Proven robust and is really popular among developers
* Good, We have members with experience on Heroku
* Bad, it has ephemeral file system, so the data file generated by neDB will be lost

### Glitch

* Good, it can persist the file
* Good, we find example using Glitch to host node app with neDB
* Bad, because nobody in our group has experience with it 

### Github Pages

* Good, easy to use and no extra steps needed
* Bad, it doesn't support storing private files

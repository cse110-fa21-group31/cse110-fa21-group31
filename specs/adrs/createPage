# Are difficulties tags?

Technical Story: The edit recipe and create recipe pages are used when the user wants to edit or create a page respectively. They're 2 separate pages.

## Context and Problem Statement

The edit and create page have the same layout but different javascript and api calls which results in some code duplication in terms of the HTML and CSS.

## Decision Drivers

* Code duplication is bad
* 

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Merging the create and edit page
* Option 2: Using the same HTML and CSS but different javascript files
* Option 3: Keeping the edit and create pages separate

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Initially chose “{option 1}” but swapped to “{option 3}”. The differing api calls and javascript would cause issues if option 1 was selected. The only way to avoid this was through JQuery, but it was simpler to keep them separate.

### Positive Consequences

* Cleaner code that is separated clearly
* Easier to debug separate pages

### Negative Consequences

* Some similar code in the edit page and create page files

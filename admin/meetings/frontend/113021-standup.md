Progress since last meeting:

TODO:
- Nav bar bug (sign in -> sign out -> sign in, and sign out) [Serina]
- Update RecipeDetail Page to only render update/save/delete with login [Danica, Tallis]
- Add pagination to home page (Possibly extend to userInfo page) [Danica, Tallis]
- Implement interaction with backend after user successfully login [Serina, Tallis]
- Tags CSS [Tallis, Serina]
- Home page recipe cards CSS [Danica, Serina]
- User page CSS [Danica, Serina]
- Try and get more comprehensive unit + end-to-end tests for more code coverage for pipeline (sonarcloud) [Euvin]
  - (especially triggering CRUD stuff)
- Try to get continuous deployment running (less priority since I think this isn’t required? would be nice to have) [Euvin]
- Recipe edit page has a “delete” button that should not be there [Danica]

Q&A:
- Difference between landing page and home page?
  - We merged them, so not much difference
- Next week’s meeting
  - Maybe - we can talk on Discord

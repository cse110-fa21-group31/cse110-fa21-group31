TODO:

Add dessert tag and group tags [Tallis Wednesday/Thursday]

Bugs to fix:

1. In the homepage, sometimes when searching, there will be an empty page at the end (steps to reproduce see github issue).

2. We need to display the page number for pagination. To do that, there's a global variable called curr_page in indexSearch.js. [Danica]

3. When we update a Recipe and the tag entry is empty, there will be an empty tag shown in the tag section (steps to reproduce see github issue). [Tallis Wednesday/Thursday, Serina (pls at me after 6 :)]

4. Reload search when clicking tags [Bjorn]

Video:

Public version

Danica will write a script for everyone to read (please record yourself reading it and send it to her before Thursday at noon)

Picture of your face (straight on) for the video

A quick tour of your Recipe Manager product (make that part sizzle to show off any features or things you are proud of) A brief retrospective of what challenges you faced, what things you felt you overcame and anything you feel you would do differently now that you are done Conclude your video with a brief point of advice for the next students (victims) of 110 projects so they crush the project

Private version

30 second video of what you worked on

Each team member should be present and in their own words state what they did on the project, what they are proud of and what they feel they could improve upon or address beyond the class (assume around ~30seconds per member)

A video discussion about how to access your repo, a tour of the repo organization and a demonstration of making a small change to the repo and the completion of the build process. You may need to write more detailed discussion of building or onboarding the product than the video supports. If so create a markdown file called "onboard.md" and put it in your documentation which goes into more details. [Danica, Euvin]

A more involved retrospective about how your Agile practices were conducted and what challenges and victories the team faced.  Honesty is the best course of action here as we are more likely to be lenient if we understand you are aware of what you didn't do well on the project and practices.  [Serina]

Conclude your video with a discussion of what things a team taking on your project should do next.  Discuss: [Serina]
 - the features not built yet 
 - improvements to the build pipeline [Euvin/Kian]
 - anything else you would have gotten to given another quarter worth of work. [Euvin/Kian]

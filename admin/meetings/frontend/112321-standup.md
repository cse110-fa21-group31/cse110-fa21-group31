Attendees: Serina, Tallis, Danica, Euvin, Xin, Celia

Date: November 23, 2021

1. Backend
- Does frontend have any questions for backend?
- Bjorn has something with the search for us to do?
- Drop down for tags (both homepage and landing page) after pressing the plus
- To do: create dummy element for tags + shows what info is displayed 
- Tags: pre-defined, finite list of ingredients, time
- Pre-fill the edit/create page
- Edit vs create page - know what kind the user is doing due to difference in backend requests
- Backend can return an HTML page?
- Disqus/comments → added div class=comments in recipeDetail.html for testing
